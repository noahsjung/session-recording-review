# AudioSection Component Refactoring

## Overview

The `AudioSection` component has been refactored to improve maintainability, readability, and component reuse. The refactoring follows the same pattern used for the `AudioPlayer` and `SessionDetail` components, breaking down a complex component into smaller, focused components.

## Folder Structure

```
src/components/audio/
├── audio-section/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── FullPlayer.tsx
│   │   ├── MiniPlayerContainer.tsx
│   │   └── TranscriptContainer.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── types.ts
│   └── usePlayerVisibility.ts
└── AudioSection.tsx (barrel file for backward compatibility)
```

## Components

### Main Component
- `index.tsx`: The main component that orchestrates all subcomponents and manages the shared state related to player visibility.

### Subcomponents
- `FullPlayer.tsx`: Responsible for rendering the full-sized audio player.
- `TranscriptContainer.tsx`: Handles the transcript display and its associated interactions.
- `MiniPlayerContainer.tsx`: Manages the mini player that appears when the main player is not visible.

### Utilities
- `types.ts`: Contains type definitions for all the components in the audio section.
- `usePlayerVisibility.ts`: A custom hook that uses the Intersection Observer API to track when the audio player is visible in the viewport.

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each component now has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.
   - The visibility logic has been extracted into a custom hook, making it reusable and testable.

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Proper TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across components.
   - Props are clearly defined, making the API contract between components explicit.

3. **Readability**:
   - Smaller, focused components are easier to understand.
   - JSDoc comments provide clear documentation for each component and function.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Components can be maintained and tested independently.
   - Changes to one component are less likely to affect others.

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility, a barrel file (`AudioSection.tsx`) is provided at the original location, re-exporting the refactored component. This ensures that existing imports continue to work without modification.
